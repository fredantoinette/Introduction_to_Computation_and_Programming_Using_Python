If a character occurs in the plain text but not in the book, something bad 
happens. The code_keys dictionary will map each such character to -1, and 
decode_keys will map -1 to whatever the last character in the book happens to 
be.

Remedy the problem described above. Hint: a simple way to do this is to create 
a new book by appending something to the original book.
